## UX Case Study – Cafe Appointment Booking App

# Problem

Many local cafes still manage reservations through phone calls, WhatsApp messages, or handwritten registers. 
This leads to missed bookings, scheduling conflicts, poor customer experience, and loss of revenue.

#  Objective

The goal was to design a mobile-first appointment booking interface that is simple, fast, and easy for first-time users while helping businesses manage reservations efficiently.

#  Target Users

* Cafe customers aged 18–40
* Busy professionals who prefer quick digital booking
* First-time users unfamiliar with complex apps

#  User Flow

Login → Select Service → Choose Host → Pick Date & Time → Confirm Booking

#  Design Decisions

* Minimal color palette to build trust
* Large touch-friendly buttons for mobile usability
* Step-by-step booking flow to reduce cognitive load
* Clear visual hierarchy for faster decision making

#  Outcome

The final design provides a smooth, intuitive booking experience that reduces friction and allows customers to complete reservations in just a few taps.
